# Stop-Signal Task (SST) – PsychoPy Builder

This repository contains a **stimulus-change Stop-Signal Task (SST)** implemented in **PsychoPy Builder**, designed according to the consensus recommendations by **Verbruggen et al. (2019)**.

The task supports both:
- ✅ **Offline (lab) testing**
- ✅ **Online deployment (Pavlovia / PsychoJS-compatible)**

It generates trial-level behavioural data suitable for **SSRT estimation**.

## 🧠 Task Overview

The Stop-Signal Task measures **response inhibition** by requiring participants to withhold an already initiated response when a stop signal occurs.

- Every trial begins as a **Go trial**
- On a minority of trials (~25%), a **Stop signal** occurs (stimulus colour changes)
- The stimulus **direction remains constant** (only colour changes)

## ✅ Task Logic

### Go Trials (~75%)
- White arrow (left or right) appears
- Participant must respond:
  - Left arrow → Left key
  - Right arrow → Right key
- Maximum response window: **1250 ms**

### Stop Trials (~25%)
- White arrow appears first
- After a variable **Stop-Signal Delay (SSD)** the arrow turns red
- Participants must **withhold the response**
  - Any keypress = failed stop
  - No response = successful stop

## ⏱ Timing Parameters (default)

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|----------|------:|-------------|
| FIX | 250 ms | Fixation duration |
| MAXRT | 1250 ms | Max response window |
| ITI | 500 ms | Inter-trial interval |
| SSD (start) | 200 ms | Initial stop-signal delay |
| SSD step | 50 ms | Staircase step size |
| Practice feedback | 750 ms | Immediate feedback |
| Block break | 15 s | Between-block break |

✅ All timings are in **milliseconds**.

## 🔁 Adaptive SSD (Staircase Procedure)

SSD is adjusted dynamically to target:

> **p(respond | stop) ≈ 0.50**

- Successful stop → SSD increases by **50 ms**
- Failed stop → SSD decreases by **50 ms**
- SSD is bounded to avoid invalid values

## 🧩 Experimental Structure

### Practice Phase
- 1 block × 32 trials
- Trial-by-trial feedback
- Block-level performance feedback

### Experimental Phase
- 4 blocks × 64 trials
- No trial-level feedback
- Block-level feedback only

Between blocks, participants see:
- Mean Go RT
- Proportion of missed Go trials (target ≈ 0)
- Proportion of successful stops (target ≈ 0.5)
